Simple pinger app for testing internet connectivity. Built using Vue.js and Primer CSS.

By default, google.com is pinged every 5 seconds while the app is enabled. Pinging can be toggled within the app.

This was built using [Vue JS 2.0](https://vuejs.org/) and [Primer CSS 4.2](http://primercss.io/). Originally built using knockout.js.
