            An outstanding reason for choosing some sort of God or spiritual-type thing to worship-be it J.C. or Allah, be it
            Yahweh or the Wiccan mother - goddess or the Four Noble Truths or some infrangible set of ethical principles -
            is that pretty much anything else you worship will eat you alive.
        </p>
        <ul style="font-size:75%;margin-bottom:.5em">
            <li><i>Worship money and things</i> - if they are where you tap real meaning in life - then you will never have enough. Never feel you have enough.</li>
            <li><i>Worship your own body and beauty and sexual allure</i> and you will always feel ugly, and when time and age start showing, you will die a million deaths before they finally plant you.</li>
            <li><i>Worship power</i> - you will feel weak and afraid, and you will need ever more power over others to keep the fear at bay.</li>
            <li><i>Worship your intellect</i>, being seen as smart - you will end up feeling stupid, a fraud, always on the verge of being found out.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="font-size:65%;margin-bottom:.5em">
            The insidious thing about these forms of worship is not that they're evil or sinful; it is that they are unconscious.
            Our own present culture has harnessed these forces in ways that have yielded extraordinary wealth and comfort and
            personal freedom. The really important kind of freedom involves attention, and awareness, and discipline, and effort,
            and being able truly to care about other people and to sacrifice for them, over and over, in myriad petty little unsexy
            ways, every day. That is real freedom.
